      1. Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a
      meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your
      pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>
      2. Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use
      the same one for all pages).
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>3. Your site must include some sort of header.</p>
    <li></li>
    <p>4. Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</p>
    <li></li>
    <p>
      5. Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens
      using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this
      activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to
      control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and
      columns (for small).
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>
      6. Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately
      describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images
      disabled, and webcrawlers

      7. Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any
      warnings or errors using the Nu Validator Links to an external site. and
      WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator Links to an external site..

    <li></li>
    <p>9. Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.</p>

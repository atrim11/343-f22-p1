    <h1>Technical Components</h1>
    <p>
      1. Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a
      meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your
      pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
    </p>
    <li>index, support us, practice, scheudle, exec</li>
    <p>
      2. Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use
      the same one for all pages).
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>3. Your site must include some sort of header.</p>
    <li>Each page has headings for it</li>
    <p>4. Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</p>
    <li>Nav Bar</li>
    <p>
      5. Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens
      using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this
      activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to
      control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and
      columns (for small).
    </p>
    <li>
      every page has a css tweak for it, or the columns collapse accordingly
    </li>
    <p>
      6. Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately
      describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images
      disabled, and webcrawlers
    </p>
    <li>there are images on every page</li>
    <p>
      7. Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any
      warnings or errors using the Nu Validator Links to an external site. and
      WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator Links to an external site..
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>
      8. Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are
      often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
    </p>
    <li>all H1's have a differnt font</li>
    <p>
      9. Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything
      at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use
      built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly
      aligned.
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>10. Your site must include links to external sites.</p>
    <li>
      The support page has links for the google forms to get the different wrist
      bands, and the go fund me pages
    </li>
    <h1>Professional Practices and Design Quality</h1>
    <p>
      1. Your site's non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed
      in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named
      css. The PDF files of your design sketch must be placed in a directory
      named design.
    </p>
    <li>✅</li>
    <p>
      2. Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated
      style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules
      not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.
    </p>
    <li>✅</li>
    <p>
      3. The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be
      clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as
      centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
    </p>
    <li>✅</li>
    <p>
      4. The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should
      never bleed against the edge of its containing box.
    </p>
    <li></li>
    <p>
      5. Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent
      formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs. Use kebab-case
      (preferred) or camelCase identifiers.
    </p>
    <li>✅</li>
    <p>
      6. Your source code should use semantic and structural elements to support
      accessible usage. You should also use ARIA Links to an external site.
      features as appropriate. In particular, you must adhere to the Level A
      recommendations in the WCAG Checklist Links to an external site..

      7. he names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only
      alphanumeric characters.
